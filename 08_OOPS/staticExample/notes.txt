Why static main?
You should be able to run main without any object since it is the first thing that will run, and how can it run inside class
since no object cannot be created without running main.
Static variables do not depend on Objects. They depend on the class.

A static method can only access an static.

Non - static belongs to an instance
Non- Static can access static


Outer classes cannot be static.

Class methods are resolved during compile time.
